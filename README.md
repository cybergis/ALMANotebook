# A<sub>gent-based</sub> L<sub>and</sub> MA<sub>rket</sub> (ALMA)

The Agent-based Land MArket (ALMA) model is a "bilateral agent-based land market model, which moves beyond previous work by explicitly modeling behavioral drivers of land-market transactions on both the buyer and seller sides; formation of bid prices (of buyers) and ask prices (of sellers); and the relative division of the gains from trade from the market transactions" ([Filatova, Parker, and van der Veen](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/1/3.html)). The model aims to understand the micro-economic decision-making that results in the emergent behavior described as the "rent gradient."

In this notebook we will work with a slightly expanded version of the ALMA model that introduces more stochasticity and heterogeniety, to understand how the rent gradient changes under various settings. For more information check out the following papers:
